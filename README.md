Image recognition is a vital component in Artificial Intelligence. To seize new opportunities, Thomson Reuters has established a centralized Cognitive Computing Center and Labs as well as decentralized data science teams across each business units such as Financial & Risk,  Tax & Accounting, Legal and News. Image classification becomes a common topic at TR.

In this challenge, we will provide you with thousands of room images and expect you to label them into one of the three categories– Bedroom, Bathroom or Kitchen. Build your own cutting-edge deep learning model to win the competition!


## Description
Build a classification model to label images into one the three categories: Bedroom, Bathroom or Kitchen
