Image recognition is a vital component in Artificial Intelligence. To seize new opportunities, Thomson Reuters has established a centralized Cognitive Computing Center and Labs as well as decentralized data science teams across each business units such as Financial & Risk,  Tax & Accounting, Legal and News. Image classification becomes a common topic at TR.

In this challenge, we will provide you with thousands of room images and expect you to label them into one of the three categories– Bedroom, Bathroom or Kitchen. Build your own cutting-edge deep learning model to win the competition!


## Description
Build a classification model to label images into one the three categories: Bedroom, Bathroom or Kitchen
  

## Data
Training dataset:  5010 rows, 2 columns

ID     -    unique identifier for each image <br>
IMAGE   -    room image in jpg format<br>
ROOM  -    Bedroom or Bathroom or Kitchen(our y label)

Testing dataset:   885 rows, 2 columns

## Submission 
(I) You can use either Python or R for this competition. <br>
(II) Send your code and predicted result file to thomsonreuters_GHC@thomsonreuters.com with a title of firstname-lastname-challenge3 (such as 'jane-doe-challenge3') <br>
(III) If there are multiple files for the code, please zip them up.
(V) Name your code firstname-lastname-code3 (such as jane-doe-code3.py or jane-doe-code3.zip). Name your result file firstname-lastname-result3.csv (such as jane-doe-result3.csv) which should strictly follow the rules below:<br>

Participant should assign the best room category for each image, which means that only one predicted room category for each image is allowed.





## Evaluation
Accuracy rate =  (correctly predicted class / total testing class) × 100%
